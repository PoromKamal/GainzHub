## Good practices for Sprint 2:
- Everyone in the team maintained good communication skills with one another
- Workflow for Sprint 2 is more consistent but more jampacked compared to Sprint 1
- The team discussed any blockers or problems they faced with JS or MongoDB or any of the tickets that are being worked on
- Everyone became more comfortable and used to the frontend and backend
- Everyone commited and pushed their tasks with meaningful commit messages on GitHub
- Everyone updated their tasks throughly via the own Jira instance that we are currently using within the given time constraint
- Everyone joined the standup meetings consistently and expressed any concerns or problems they had regarding their respective tickets
- Everyone asked one another for help on their tickets if they got stuck

## Harmful practices to stop for Sprint 3:
- Sprint deliverables still being left last minute
- New functions added into the project not consistently being updated into the documentation
- Some of us tends to delay posting our current standup meeting notes up until the next standup meeting

## New practices for Sprint 3:
- Maintain a satisfactory routine for Sprint 3 so the timeline for this sprint can be planned properly without leaving certain components until the last minute
- Make sure that the primary user stories are started and that a sufficient amount of these primary user stories will be done by the end of Sprint 3
- Ensure that tickets that are considered as prerequisites are being prioritized so that blocked tickets can be worked on as soon as possible 
- Distribute work evenly to ensure it aligns with everyone's schedule and needs

## Best experience for Sprint 2:
- No conflicts arose between any of the team members and everyone was cool with each other and the tasks that they were working on
- Everyone is informed and updated with what every team member is working on
- More features of the app are considered done and everyone is satisfied with the current state of the project

## Worst experience for Sprint 2:
- Prerequisites not being completed within the time constraint therefore new tickets could not be started hence delaying some tickets into the next sprint
- Tons of midterms and assignments from other courses which hindered everyone's availability to focus working on the project
- 1 week time constraint for Sprint 2 which in general is not enough therefore necessitating everyone to rush and speed up on their tickets for this sprint
- Due to this 1 week constraint, some tickets are not completed and therefore forced to be move to the next sprint
- More research on how to approach some tickets for this sprint due to the lack of JS and MongoDB knowledge as these technologies are still fairly new to some of the team members
