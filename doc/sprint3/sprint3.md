# Sprint 3 Planning Meetings
The Sprint 3 planning meeting was held on Oct 25th, 2022 on Discord. During this meeting we discussed our goals for Sprint 3, and the stories we would accomplish by the end of the sprint. We agreed to break down stories into subtasks due to their huge workload, and discussed how we would divide them. Tasks were then distributed in an optimized way, due to the never-ending amount of assignments and midterms from other courses, to improve development efficiency.

# Task Breakdown

## BRAV-6
- As a user interested in nutrition, I want to save popular meals within the app to my collection so that I can use meals from accredited content creators
- This feature ensures that users will be able to improve their meal plan by using certified meal plans from experts

## BRAV-71
- Added progress tracking navbar
- Accessing the progress tracking page will be more convenient and made easier

## BRAV-73
- Modified the nutrition tab navbar buttons due to them having oversized hitboxes
- The buttons should remain consistent to enable a better user experience and to make the app look neater

## BRAV-82
- Developed backend full search engine for workouts
- Enables the user to search different workouts easily without needing to navigate the whole page

## BRAV-7
- As a user interested in nutrition, I want to rate published meal plans within the app so that I can provide feedback to content creators
- Users will be able to rate each meal plan out of 5 which will affect the user's overall meal rating so that better meal plans can be suggested to the user going forward

## BRAV-63
- As a user interested in nutrition, I should be able to delete and edit my existing meal plans
- This provides the user an option to abandon one of their current meal plans if they do not find it effective

## BRAV-80
- Form validation for the calorie calculator
- Eliminates the user from inputting letters in fields such as the age and weight fields to ensure that nothing crashes in the backend

## BRAV-81
- Form validation for the meal plan form
- Prevents the user from inputting letters in fields such as the calories and protein fields which ensures that the backend won't crash and will work properly

## BRAV-70
- Creation of workout playlists
- Easily group the different kinds of workouts that a user wants to do on a particular day

## BRAV-75
- As a social user, I want the ability to post/read my social feed so my followers can see my current updates
- Users will be able to post content on their social page to show their followers what they are up to when it comes to working out

## BRAV-18
- As a progress tracking user I want to calculate my approximated BMI, and bodyfat percentage based off my body weight, age, height, and other metrics so that I can have an approximation of my current health
- This feature will give the user the ability to judge whether the current meal plan and workout playlist they are currently utilizing are deemed effective enough

## BRAV-14
- As a progress tracking user, I want to input my body weight, and keep a record of my inputted body weight in chronological order so that I can keep a record of my weight changes throughout my fitness journey
- Helps the user keep track of their body weight throughout their fitness journey and also helps them judge whether their meal plan or workout playlist needs some modification



# Spikes/Blockers
- Using React Native is still fairly new to many of us so it takes a lot of research before implementing certain tasks
- Certain stories/tasks need other stories/tasks as a prerequisite
- A lot of the team members have midterms and assignments for the duration of this sprint
- Work capacity will fluctuate based off our personal schedules (ie. exam season, times of increased workload, personal reasons)
- Certain UI issues, for example sliders not working properly on web (reported issue online)
