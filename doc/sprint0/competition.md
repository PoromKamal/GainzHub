## MyFitnessPal (https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)

* MyFitnessPal is the general standard for fitness apps. It allows users to keep track of their nutrition and workouts, in addition to receiving advice from other members through the community page. It is regarded as the best app for nutrition tracking on Forbes (Hall, 2022).

Key Differences and Solutions:

* MyFitnessPal’s main limitation is its paid membership.
 
    * For new users, it could be discouraging that their fitness journey is blocked by a subscription. These new users are not entirely sure that they are going to continue their journey in the future, so only giving them access to the most basic features might push them into thinking that their fitness journey is not the greatest idea, especially when they might be financially limited. The developers of MyFitnessPal probably did not consider this because the app needs a way of making a profit; however, we believe that there are other methods that would not discourage users. For example, profit could be made from ads and paid plans created by professional personal trainers or influencers. Charges could also be made for influencers/personal trainers building their brand on our social media platform.


* Dated social media/community section.

    * Currently, the community page of MyFitnessPal is like Reddit, with discussion posts and blogs; however, modern social media has moved past simple discussion posts and to photos and videos. In addition, the community page is not tailored to a particular individual, as it just gives all the possible topics at once, which does not lead to the greatest user experience, as a user could be overwhelmed by hundreds of different discussion boards.


* Lack of free workout and meal plans. 

    * To get these plans you would have to go to the community section and hope that someone posted a plan, or again pay the premium fee to get meal plans (not workout plans). Having pages for these plans will allow all users easy access to get started or learn new strategies. These pages will also allow personal trainers to post plans they created, allowing them to grow their brand.


* Lack of gym information.

    * Many new people on their fitness journey are unaware of which gyms they should go to, leading to external research about different gyms in their area. Our application will have a feature showing cheapest and best rated membership plans for different gyms, allowing people to get the best plans for their fitness journey while not feeling discouraged by the membership prices. This feature will also allow local gyms to post their own gym membership plans as advertising for their gym.

## FitOn (https://app.fitonapp.com/)

* The best rated fitness app on Forbes, which includes many different workouts and live classes to make exercising fun and interactive (Hall, 2022).

Key Differences and Solutions:

* All meal plans are blocked by a paid membership.

    * The main aspect that many new gym-goers struggle with is their nutrition. When someone is first starting to care about their health, there is a stigma regarding the bland and uninspired food that is required for a healthy diet. This could prevent new gym-goers from starting their journey, so giving them the option of viewing nutritious and great-tasting diets will keep them motivated to reach their fitness goals. Our application allows access to free meal plans unless a fitness influencer decides to make a charge for their plan (possible feature to make profit from the application). 


* No nutrition calculator.

    * Multiple applications would be required for new gym-goers to keep track of their nutrition, one for workouts (FitOn), and the other for nutrition (probably MyFitnessPal), leading to a more complicated process for reaching one’s fitness goals.


* The social media platform only allows you to connect to friends or view FitOn’s own posts, you cannot find any posts other than FitOn (only new people are the ones posting to FitOn comments)

    * This would limit the amount of advertising that gym-owners and Personal Trainers could preform, harming their businesses. In addition, users will not be able to see the opinions and viewpoints of other people in fitness, reducing the amount of information they can gain about reaching their fitness goals.


* No platform showing nearby gyms, also no prices are shown.

    * Users need to research different websites to determine which gym is best to go to regarding quality and price. This might deter new users who are not fully invested in starting their fitness journey.



## Strong Workout Tracker (https://www.strong.app/)

* A workout tracker, which allows users to customise and track different workouts, is noted as the best application for experienced gym-goers on Forbes (Hall, 2022).

Key Differences and Solutions:

* No social media aspect.

    * This prevents new gym-goers from learning more about fitness and connecting to other gym-goers and Personal Trainers to help guide them on their fitness journey. Our application will have a social feed which will be more beneficial to new users, as they can connect and learn more about their fitness journey, in addition to gym owners and Personal Trainers, who will be able to advertise themselves on the app.


* No nutrition calculator.

    * Like the problem with FitOn, multiple different apps would be required to keep track of everything that an experienced gym-goer would require. This would involve using a tool like MyFitnessPal for nutrition and Strong Workout Tracker for workout logs.
