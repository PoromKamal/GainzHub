# Sprint 0 Process

## Team Organization

• Initially, everyone mutually agreed to an initial meeting on discord, where everyone introduced themselves, stated what we are each individually trying to  accomplish,   discused the tasks for sprint 0 and what type of application we are trying to build. 

• Everyone proposed and presented 1-2 potential app ideas for the project and through a democratic veto/elimination system, we deduced the options to 4, in which we all   discussed, debated and finally mutually agreed on an intensive fitness app.

• Each group member each took the initiative to choose which deliverable they preferred doing and assigned it to themselves as follows:  


| Task | Team Member(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| team.md | Everyone |
| team-contract.pdf | Jason created; everyone signs it |
| summary.md | Dominik | 
| competition.md | Dominik | 
| personas.md | Avi |
| PB.md | Porom |
| Setup | Porom |
| UX/UI | Everyone participated |
| done.md | Bryan |
| process.md | Ryan |
| README.md | Kevin |


• For every deliverable assigned, each assignee created their own private Google Document and completed it, and upon finishing, they released it on Github as a .MD file for other peers to revise and edit each file. 

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Discord | Free to use online chatting software used to communicate with teammates and utilized for scrum meetings |
| Github / Git | Used as the version control system for the project (commits / sprints) |
| Jira | Will be used for coordinating the work and planning sprints that is required for the project (Agile) |
| Figma | Used for creating prototypes and frontend mock designs for the UX/UI of our app |

## Decision Making

• All decisions and discussion took place in our group Discord via text/voice channels which usually occured during meetings/standups. For example, choosing our project topic was a controversial topic and to solve this we all advocated ideas and implemented an anonymous polling system to allow for fair decision making.   

## User Story Points

• For many, selecting priority for User Stories and overall tasks for a project is difficult and can take a lot of time to estimate. 

• For us, upon the creation of User Stories, we created a rough outline of the tasks/stories that have high and low priority, since it will give us a better idea of how much work would go into implementing these features and the amount of members working on them.

Although it was subjective, we defined High Priority as:

> Stories that would allow us to demo a functional app

> Stories that contribute to core functionality / features that put us above compeititors

> Stories that require a lot of work (Backend/Frontend intensive)


Similarily, we defined Low Priority as:
  
> Stories that do not require a lot of work (Backend/Frontend simple implementations)

> Stories that are extra / add more to the User Experience

• Moving forward, we plan to use Jira and its extraordinary Agile software to implement the Planning Poker technique to address specific points (using the Fibonacci Sequence point system) for each User Story to get an even better understanding of the stories and its difficulties, so we can work and assign individuals accordingly.  


## Meetings

• Meetings took place frequently (2-3 Days) and the times schedules were discussed beforehand to optimize everyones schedules (usually between 6:00 PM & 9:00 PM.) 

• Meetings generally took 30 mins - 1hr in which everyone would discuss the tasks they performed and how they plan to contribute in the future 

## Next Phase

• Going into our next phase (Sprint 1), we will definitely consider being more collaborative to help each other since a lot of the technologies and languages we are utilizing are unfamiliar to some, therefore it is important that we work together to ensure better work flow. 

• We will also prioritize communication by utilizing the Discord chat more frequently to ensure everyone is working at a comfortable pace and to manage everyones progress. We will also consider holding meetings more frequently for similar reasons.

• Finally, we will start being more punctual and organized so that we are able to meet strict deadlines for upcoming sprints, so that there are minimal conflicts between us and the completion of the project.
