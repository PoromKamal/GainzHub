## Team Organization

• Initially, everyone mutually agreed to an initial meeting on discord, where everyone introduced themselves, stated what we are each individually trying to  accomplish,   discused the tasks for sprint 0 and what type of application we are trying to build. 

• Everyone proposed and presented 1-2 potential app ideas for the project and through a democratic veto/elimination system, we deduced the options to 4, in which we all   discussed, debated and finally mutually agreed on an intensive fitness app.

• Each group member each took the initiative to choose which deliverable they preferred doing and assigned it to themselves as follows:  


| Task | Team Member(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| team.md | everyone |

> team.md: everyone 

> team-contract.pdf: Jason creates & everyone signs it

> summary.md: Dominik

> competition.md: Dominik 

> personas.md: Avi

> PB.md: Porom

> Setup: Porom

> UX / UI: Everyone participates

> done.md: Bryan 

> process.md: Ryan

> README.md: Kevin 

• For every deliverable assigned, each assignee created their own private Google Document and completed it, and upon finishing, they released it on Github as a .MD file for other peers to revise and edit each file.
