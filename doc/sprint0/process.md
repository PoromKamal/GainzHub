## Team Organization

• Initially, everyone mutually agreed to an initial meeting on discord, where everyone introduced themselves, stated what we are each individually trying to  accomplish,   discused the tasks for sprint 0 and what type of application we are trying to build. 

• Everyone proposed and presented 1-2 potential app ideas for the project and through a democratic veto/elimination system, we deduced the options to 4, in which we all   discussed, debated and finally mutually agreed on an intensive fitness app.

• Each group member each took the initiative to choose which deliverable they preferred doing and assigned it to themselves as follows:  


| Task | Team Member(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| team.md | everyone |
| team-contract.pdf | Jason created; everyone signs it |
| summary.md | Dominik | 
| competition.md | Dominik | 
| personas.md | Avi |
| PB.md | Porom |
| Setup | Porom |
| UX/UI | Everyone participated |
| done.md | Bryan |
| process.md | Ryan |
| README.md | Kevin |


• For every deliverable assigned, each assignee created their own private Google Document and completed it, and upon finishing, they released it on Github as a .MD file for other peers to revise and edit each file. 

## Decision Making

• All decisions and discussion took place in our group Discord via text/voice channels which usually occured during meetings/standups. For example, choosing our project topic was a controversial topic and to solve this we all advocated ideas and implemented an anonymous polling system to allow for fair decision making.
