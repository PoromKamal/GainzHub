Gainzhub is a social media platform designed to aid and motivate anyone who’s passionate about fitness or ready to begin their fitness journey. 

## Motivation

Gainzhub blends both fitness advice and instruction, with connection to friends so you and your connections can motivate one another to be the healthiest you possible. 
In addition, you will no longer need multiple apps to track calories, meal plans, workout plans, and to record your workouts. Gainzhub will allow you to 
keep track of personal gains and socialize with others who are also setting personal goals for themselves.
