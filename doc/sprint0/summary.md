# Summary

Company Name: GainzHub 

Objective: Build a collaborative fitness platform that is free to use and combines, into a single application, all different aspects of fitness that are generally found on different apps, such as nutrition logs, workouts, progress, and fitness calculators. The application also implements a social feed to allow users to post their progress and to connect with other individuals on their fitness journey, as well as Personal Trainers (PTs) and fitness influencers to guide them. In addition, gym owners, PTs, and fitness influencers can advertise and sell their products (gym memberships and plans) on the website to avoid users having to pay a membership for features.

Key Personas/Users: 

• Henry Preston, a 24-year-old person who lives a sedentary lifestyle due to his office job, has many insecurities about being overweight. Henry had never cared about what and how much he ate, and never exercised mainly due to his sedentary job. 

• Mark White, a 22-year-old gym enthusiast who works in construction, has a very active lifestyle because he is on his feet all day while working. Mark has been into fitness all his life. He was on different sport teams in high school, and he continues to be apart of several adult sport leagues, in addition to having a gym membership at Pan Am to stay active. 

• Julia Florence, a 30-year-old personal trainer, spent years working towards her degree in biomechanics, and combined with her love of the gym, is extremely knowledgeable about all exercises. However, Julia is quite introverted and shy, and rarely goes up and talks to people she does not know.

Key Scenarios:

• Henry is tired of being overweight and wants to make a change in his lifestyle improve his health and build his confidence. He conducted some primary research on where to start but felt overwhelmed about the numerous workouts and he does not know which workouts he should try. Henry also does not know what foods he should start eating and how to keep track of them, as he always just ate whatever he felt like. 

• Mark has been working out for years but feels like he is quite thin, so he decides to go on a bulk. To do this, Mark searched a reliable caloric needs calculator on Google to find out how many calories he should eat. He also needs to download and use MyFitnessPal to keep track of the food he eats so that he meets his daily goal. While working out, he keeps track of his workouts on the Notes app of his iPhone, and to get advice from fitness influencers, he goes on Instagram and Tik Tok to view their posts regarding bulking. Mark wishes he could have one app where he could do everything.

• Julia noticed that after gyms have started reopening after Covid, more newcomers were showing up to the gym. She observed that the newcomers were confused and had no structure to their exercises, nor their plan. Julia created a sample workout geared towards newcomers, including a meal plan and a workout plan. However, she does not feel comfortable going up to people to sell her plans. 

Key Principles:

• Available features to users’ over paid memberships – The design should not prevent users from accessing different features through a paid membership, even if it means that the profit margins might not be as high.

• Strong user interface over complicated systems – The design should not overwhelm users new on their fitness journey, even if it limits the possibility of complex features being created.
