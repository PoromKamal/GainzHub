# Summary

## Company Name: GainzHub 

* Objective: Build a collaborative fitness platform that is free to use and combines, into a single application, all different aspects of fitness that are generally found on different apps, such as nutrition logs, workouts, progress, and fitness calculators. The application also implements a social feed to allow users to post their progress and to connect with other individuals on their fitness journey, as well as Personal Trainers (PTs) and fitness influencers to guide them. In addition, gym owners, PTs, and fitness influencers can advertise and sell their products (gym memberships and plans) on the website to avoid users having to pay a membership for features.

* Key Personas/Users: 

    * John Webster, a 35-year-old person who lives a sedentary lifestyle due to his accounting job and has many insecurities about being overweight. John has never cared about what and how much he ate, and never exercised mainly due to his sedentary job. 

    * Hana Johnston, a 34-year-old gym enthusiast, is also a professional cycler. Hana has been into fitness all her life and has a very active lifestyle through her cycling career. She is very conscious of her nutrition, constantly tracking it with the help of her physician.

    * David Moreno, a 29-year-old personal trainer, who treats fitness as a passion, is extremely knowledgeable about nutrition and exercises. David is constantly pushing other people into fitness and is looking into spreading his knowledge beyond the clients at his local gym.

* Key Scenarios:

    * John is tired of being overweight and wants to make a change in his lifestyle to improve his health and build his confidence. He conducted some primary research on where to start but felt overwhelmed about the numerous workouts and he does not know which workouts he should try. Henry also does not know what foods he should start eating, and how to keep track of them, as he always just ate whatever he felt like. 

    * Hana has been working out for years because of her professional cycling career. One day, her physician decided that going on a small bulk would help her career. To do this, Hana searched a reliable caloric needs calculator on Google to find out how many calories she should eat. She uses her Notes app on her iPhone to keep track of what she eats as well as her workouts. To get advice from fitness influencers, she goes on Instagram and Tik Tok to view their posts regarding bulking. Hana wishes she could have one app where she could do everything.

    * David noticed that once gyms started to reopen after Covid, more newcomers were showing up to the gym. He observed that the newcomers were confused and had no structure to their exercises, nor their meal plan. David created a sample workout geared towards newcomers, including a meal and workout plan. However, he wishes that he could connect people with his information throughout the world.

* Key Principles:

    * Available features to users’ over paid memberships – The design should not prevent users from accessing different features through a paid membership, even if it means that the profit margins might not be as high.

    * Strong user interface over complicated systems – The design should not overwhelm users new on their fitness journey, even if it limits the possibility of complex features being created.
