## Good practices for Sprint 3:
- Everyone in the team maintained good communication skills with one another
- Everyone started their user stories earlier, leading to more features completed during the sprint
- Workflow for Sprint 3 is more consistent but more jampacked compared to Sprint 2
- The team discussed any blockers or problems they faced with JS or MongoDB or any of the tickets that are being worked on
- Everyone became more comfortable and used to the frontend and backend, leading to more features being completed during the sprint
- Everyone commited and pushed their tasks with meaningful commit messages on GitHub
- Everyone updated their tasks throughly via the own Jira instance that we are currently using within the given time constraint
- Everyone joined the standup meetings consistently and expressed any concerns or problems they had regarding their respective tickets
- Everyone asked one another for help on their tickets if they got stuck
- Everyone promptly responded to questions asked providing feedback and solutions
- Everyone managed their time well with the other midterms and assignments taking place during the sprint

## Harmful practices to stop for Sprint 4:
- Sprint deliverables still being left last minute
- New functions added into the project not consistently being updated into the documentation
- Some of us tends to delay posting our current standup meeting notes up until the next standup meeting
- Trying to complete an entire user story before committing it (there should be multiple commits to that pull request, or include more child issues)

## New practices for Sprint 4:
- Maintain a satisfactory routine for Sprint 4 so the timeline for this sprint can be planned properly without leaving certain components until the last minute
- Make sure that the primary user stories are started and that a sufficient amount of these primary user stories will be done by the end of Sprint 4
- Ensure that tickets that are considered as prerequisites are being prioritized so that blocked tickets can be worked on as soon as possible 
- Commit more frequently or include more child issues to avoid problems with unsaved work or merge conflicts
- Review and merge features into developmeant as soon as possible, to allow others to work on features as soon as possible

## Best experience for Sprint 3:
- No conflicts arose between any of the team members and everyone was cool with each other and the tasks that they were working on
- Everyone is informed and updated with what every team member is working on
- Everyone is familiar with React Native, allowing for features being completed sooner
- More features of the app are considered done and everyone is satisfied with the current state of the project

## Worst experience for Sprint 3:
- Prerequisites not being completed within the time constraint therefore new tickets could not be started hence delaying some tickets into the next sprint
- Tons of midterms and assignments from other courses which hindered everyone's availability to focus working on the project
- More research on how to approach some tickets for this sprint due to the lack of JS and MongoDB knowledge as these technologies are still fairly new to some of the team members
