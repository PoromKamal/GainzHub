# Sprint 4 Planning Meetings
The Sprint 4 planning meeting was held on Nov 9th, 2022 on Discord. During this meeting we discussed our goals for Sprint 4 (mainly completing the Social Page), and the stories we would accomplish by the end of the sprint. We agreed to break down stories into subtasks due to their huge workload, and discussed how we would divide them. Tasks were then distributed in an optimized way, due to the never-ending amount of assignments and midterms from other courses, to improve development efficiency.
