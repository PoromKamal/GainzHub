# Sprint 2 Planning Meetings
The Sprint 2 planning meeting was held on Oct 16th, 2022 on Discord. During this meeting we discussed our goal for Sprint 2, and the stories we would accomplish by the end of the sprint. We also discussed how we are going to break down the stories into subtask, and distribute the tasks in a way to optimize development efficiency.

Different task were evenely distributed and we started planning when should member's report back to the team with either completed task or a part of the completed task.

Different task were also broken down into subtask because only week for the sprint2. Alot of feedback was given to us from the Project Demo which we to sure to keep in our mind. Project Demo was also due this week so we had to come preared as a team to give our best out.
