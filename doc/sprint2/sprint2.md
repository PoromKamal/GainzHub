# Sprint 2 Planning Meetings
The Sprint 2 planning meeting was held on Oct 16th, 2022 on Discord. During this meeting we discussed our goal for Sprint 2, and the stories we would accomplish by the end of the sprint. We also discussed how we are going to break down the stories into subtask, and distribute the tasks in a way to optimize development efficiency.

Different tasks were evenly distributed and we started planning when should each member report back to the team with either a completed task or a part of the completed task.

Different tasks were also broken down into subtasks because we only  had w week for sprint2. A lot of feedback was given to us from the Project Demo which we made sure to keep in mind. Project Demo was also due this week so we had to come prepared as a team to give our best out.

Because of only a week given we had to add a extra meeting on Sunday to keep a minumum of 3 meetings.

# Spikes/Blockers
- Using JS Native is still fairly new to many of us so it takes alot of research before implementing something
- Certain stories/tasks need other stories/tasks to be completed first.
- Alot of members have midterms and assignments for the whole week
- Work capacity will fluctuate based off our personal schedules (ie. exam season, times of increased workload)
- Certain UI issues, for example sliders not working properly on web (reported issue online)
