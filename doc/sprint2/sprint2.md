# Sprint 2 Planning Meetings
The Sprint 2 planning meeting was held on Oct 16th, 2022 on Discord. During this meeting we discussed our goal for Sprint 2, and the stories we would accomplish by the end of the sprint. We agreed to break down stories into subtasks due to their large size, and discussed how we would divide them. Tasks were then distributed in an optimized way, due to the sheer amount of assignments and midterms from other courses, to improve development efficiency. 

Due to reading week, we decided to have an extra meeting on Sunday to enure at least 3 standups were completed.

# Spikes/Blockers
- Using React Native is still fairly new to many of us so it takes alot of research before implementing something
- Certain stories/tasks need other stories/tasks to be completed first.
- Alot of members have midterms and assignments for the whole week
- Work capacity will fluctuate based off our personal schedules (ie. exam season, times of increased workload)
- Certain UI issues, for example sliders not working properly on web (reported issue online)
