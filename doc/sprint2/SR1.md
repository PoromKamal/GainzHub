## Good practices for Sprint 1:
- Everyone maintained good communication with a team
- The team is discussing any blockers or problems they are facing with JS or MongoDB 
- Everyone is getting comfortable with Frontend and Backend instead of each member only working on Frontend/Backend
- Everyone pushed their work with commit messages on Github  
- Everyone updating the JIRA on time and keeping with JIRA user stories

## Harmful practices to stop for Sprint 2:
- Sprint Deliverables are left for last minute
- New functions added into the code are not being updated to  the 'sprint document'
- Some primary User Stories have still not started

## New practices for Sprint 2:
- Keep a good routine for Sprint2, so nearly every day is pre planned so we don't leave stuff at the last minute
- Making sure primary tasks are the main priority right now
- Dependencies of the Depend are getting finished asap, so no more delay 
- Try to distribute work fairly, so it aligns with everyone's schedule

## Best experience for Sprint 1:
- Work getting finished, something of the applications coming up
- Everyone is aligned with what each member is doing

## Worst experience for Sprint 1:
- Random Error's delaying the work
- Research because of the Unfamiliarity of JS and Mongodb
