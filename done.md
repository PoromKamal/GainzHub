#BravoSixâ€™s Definition of Done

##We anticipate developing 4 main aspects within our web application. These include:

Within the webapp, a section will be dedicated to nutrition. Each user can manage their daily calories while also setting caloric goals. This section will also provide the ability to create meal plans of the user's choice. Accessing these meals will be easily accessible and convenient. The collection of meal plans can also be published to the public allowing other users to save and apply a rating to the specific meal plan. Similarly, a user can save a popular meal to their own collection while also leaving behind a review. 

The exercise section will be targeted towards users who want to manage their daily workouts. Each user can create a workout routine with an option to publish it to the public so that other users can follow their routine. Publishing a routine also means other users may rate and comment on the specific routine. Following each workout, keeping track of which routine/exercises were completed should be recorded in chronological order. 

The progress section will provide an area to input body weight, BMI, body fat percentage at intervals chosen by the user so that they can track their progress over time. The app will also provide insight on ideal numbers for BMI, body weight, body fat, etc based on body variables provided by the user. In addition to body progression, the user will be able to track workout progression. Inputting reps and weight for specific exercises will allow a visualization of progression.

Users can also create a profile to set foot into a social aspect to exercise. The user will be able to create a personalized profile that they can log into and showcase meal plans, routines of their choice. Within the social section, users can search for other users and interact with them by following and messaging them. They can also share photos related to their workouts for others to see. 

All user data such as nutrition logs , exercise logs , progress logs, and profile data will be saved on the cloud. 

No users stories will be marked as done until:
* At least one team members reviews it and approves it on Jira
* Reviewed by ensuring all test pass
* Ensuring user story is working correctly in the master branch
